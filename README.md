Very useful library to implement async processes, 
e.g. delayed emails sending, invoice generation, video conversion, calculation of large amount of data etc, 
in short for all cases, when the direct sync execution is not possible or in a limited resource env. 
Thanks to queue integration it is possible to scale and distribute the load among multiple nodes very easily. 
The library allows to integrate different queue backends and contains already integrated amqp implementation.
